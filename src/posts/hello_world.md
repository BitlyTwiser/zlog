```
Can I be seen? Do I render?

I have gone down the path of curating my own, small, blogging platform mostly out of being unwilling to utilize some abstract blogging service etc.. etc.. 
Perhaps I am just lazy? Perhaps I am just too much into building things (over engineering)?

Nontheless, we ended up here with a small platform to curate our random thoughts, cool stuff we encounter in the digital world, and displaying our abstract runminations to the greater electronic world.

Why does it matter? I reality, it doesnt! I am just an engineer with a passion for creating things, learning, programming, and exploaring this vast digital world. I have been working in software curation for almost 8 years now, and this is my first time really blogging.

Hopefully we can craft some fun things that I can look back on in the future and enjoy. Perhaps someone will ready them (in which case, hello future lifeform!).
