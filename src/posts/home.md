Welcome to the homepage of my personal website. Here, you'll find various articles on things I find interesting, some oddball ruminations and other oddities.


This site is very basic on purpose, its built using a small static site generate parsing markdown files, written entirely in Zig: [Check out the code here](https://github.com/BitlyTwiser/zlog)
Its only purpose is to have some blogging medium and write some Zig. :)
